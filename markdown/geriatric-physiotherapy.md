# Geriatric Physiotherapy at Home – Enhancing Mobility, Balance & Independent Living

Geriatric physiotherapy focuses on supporting older adults in maintaining mobility, strength, balance, and functional independence as they age. Natural age-related changes, chronic health conditions, and reduced physical activity can significantly affect movement, confidence, and quality of life.

Through structured, evidence-based physiotherapy programs, elderly individuals can continue to perform daily activities safely, reduce pain, and maintain independence for as long as possible.

## What Is Geriatric Physiotherapy?

Geriatric physiotherapy is a specialised area of physiotherapy designed to address the unique physical needs of older adults. Treatment focuses on functional movement, fall prevention, pain management, and rehabilitation from age-related, medical, or surgical conditions.

Programs are carefully adapted to an individual’s health status, endurance, and tolerance levels.

## Why Geriatric Physiotherapy Is Important

As people age, muscle strength decreases, joint mobility reduces, balance becomes less stable, and reaction time slows. These changes increase the risk of falls, injuries, and dependency on others.

Geriatric physiotherapy helps to:
- Improve balance and coordination  
- Maintain muscle strength and endurance  
- Reduce joint pain and stiffness  
- Improve walking ability  
- Enhance confidence and independence  
- Reduce fall-related injuries

## Conditions Treated in Geriatric Physiotherapy

- Osteoarthritis and joint degeneration  
- Osteoporosis-related weakness  
- Balance and fall-risk issues  
- Generalised muscle weakness  
- Post-surgical rehabilitation  
- Neurological conditions such as Parkinson’s disease  
- Chronic pain and mobility limitations

## Geriatric Physiotherapy Treatment Approach

Treatment programs are individualised and may include:

- Strength and endurance training  
- Balance and coordination exercises  
- Gait and walking training  
- Postural correction  
- Pain management strategies  
- Breathing and relaxation exercises  
- Education on safe movement and fall prevention  

Progression is gradual and based on safety, comfort, and functional improvement.
