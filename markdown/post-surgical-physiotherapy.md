# Post-Surgical Physiotherapy at Home – Safe Healing, Strength & Functional Recovery

Post-surgical physiotherapy is a critical phase of recovery following orthopaedic and general surgeries. While surgery addresses the structural issue, physiotherapy restores movement, strength, coordination, and confidence needed for daily activities. Without guided rehabilitation, patients may experience stiffness, muscle weakness, pain, and delayed recovery.

Home-based post-surgical physiotherapy provides structured, progressive care in a familiar environment, supporting safe healing and optimal long-term outcomes.

## What Is Post-Surgical Physiotherapy?

Post-surgical physiotherapy is a rehabilitation program initiated after surgery to promote healing, restore mobility, and regain functional independence. Programs are designed according to surgical protocols and are adapted to the stage of healing, pain levels, and individual tolerance.

Physiotherapy focuses on controlled movement, swelling reduction, pain management, and gradual strengthening—while protecting surgical repairs.

## Why Post-Surgical Physiotherapy Is Essential

After surgery, tissues require guided movement to heal properly. Prolonged immobilisation can lead to stiffness, muscle wasting, reduced circulation, and functional decline.

Post-surgical physiotherapy helps to:
- Reduce pain and swelling  
- Restore joint range of motion  
- Prevent stiffness and muscle weakness  
- Improve balance and coordination  
- Support safe return to daily activities  
- Reduce the risk of complications

## Surgeries Commonly Requiring Physiotherapy

- Knee and hip replacement  
- ACL and ligament reconstruction  
- Fracture fixation surgeries  
- Shoulder surgeries (rotator cuff repair, dislocation)  
- Spine surgeries (after surgeon clearance)  
- Abdominal and general surgeries (as advised)

## Phases of Post-Surgical Rehabilitation

### Phase 1: Early Recovery
Focuses on pain control, swelling management, gentle movement, breathing exercises, and safe mobility including bed transfers and walking with aids.

### Phase 2: Strength & Mobility Restoration
Gradual improvement of joint movement, muscle activation, posture correction, and controlled strengthening.

### Phase 3: Functional Rehabilitation
Advanced strengthening, balance training, gait correction, and functional tasks required for work, home, or recreational activities.

Physiotherapy typically begins once medical stability is confirmed by the surgeon.

### Is pain normal during therapy?
Mild discomfort may occur, but exercises are adapted to tolerance.

### How long does post-surgical rehab take?
Recovery duration varies depending on the surgery and individual healing response.

### Can therapy be done entirely at home?
