# Orthopaedic Physiotherapy in Bangalore – Comprehensive Musculoskeletal Rehabilitation

Orthopaedic physiotherapy focuses on the assessment, treatment, and rehabilitation of conditions affecting the musculoskeletal system, including bones, joints, muscles, ligaments, and tendons. It plays a crucial role in pain management, injury recovery, post-surgical rehabilitation, and restoration of functional movement.

## What Is Orthopaedic Physiotherapy?

Orthopaedic physiotherapy is a specialised branch of physiotherapy that deals with mechanical and structural issues of the body. Treatment begins with a detailed clinical assessment, including posture analysis, movement testing, strength evaluation, and functional assessment.

Based on this assessment, a customised rehabilitation plan is created to reduce pain, restore mobility, improve strength, and help patients return to normal activities safely.

## Role of Orthopaedic Physiotherapy in Pain Management

Pain related to musculoskeletal conditions often results from poor movement patterns, weakness, stiffness, or tissue overload. Physiotherapy addresses the root causes of pain rather than only symptoms, helping reduce dependence on medication and improve long-term outcomes.

## Post-Surgical Orthopaedic Rehabilitation

After surgeries such as joint replacement, ligament reconstruction, or fracture fixation, physiotherapy is essential to:

- Reduce swelling and pain  
- Restore joint range of motion  
- Rebuild muscle strength  
- Improve balance and coordination  
- Support safe return to daily activities  

Rehabilitation follows surgeon protocols and is adapted to each stage of healing.
