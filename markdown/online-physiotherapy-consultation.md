# Online Physiotherapy Consultation in India – Expert Care from the Comfort of Home

Online physiotherapy consultation is a modern, evidence-based approach that allows individuals to receive professional physiotherapy guidance without visiting a clinic. Using secure video consultations, licensed physiotherapists assess posture, movement patterns, pain behaviour, and functional limitations to design personalised rehabilitation programs that can be safely performed at home.

This service is particularly valuable for working professionals, elderly individuals, post-surgical patients, and people living in areas with limited access to physiotherapy clinics. Online physiotherapy bridges the gap between expert care and convenience while maintaining clinical safety and effectiveness.

## What Is Online Physiotherapy Consultation?

Online physiotherapy consultation involves real-time interaction between a patient and a qualified physiotherapist via video calls. During these sessions, the physiotherapist conducts a detailed assessment, observes movement and posture, identifies contributing factors to pain or dysfunction, and prescribes targeted exercises and movement corrections.

While hands-on techniques are not part of online care, research-backed exercise therapy, posture correction, education, and progressive loading form the foundation of effective rehabilitation for many conditions.
